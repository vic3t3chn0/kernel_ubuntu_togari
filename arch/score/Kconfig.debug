	help
	  On some platforms, there is currently no way for the boot loader to
	  pass arguments to the kernel. For these platforms, you can supply
	  some command-line options at build time by entering them here.  In
	  other cases you can specify kernel args so that you don't have
	  to set them up in board prom initialization routines.

	help
	  If you say Y here, some debugging macros will do run-time checking.
	  If you say N here, those macros will mostly turn to no-ops.  See
<<<<<<< HEAD
