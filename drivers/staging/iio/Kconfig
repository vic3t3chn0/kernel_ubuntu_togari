	tristate "Industrial I/O support"
	depends on GENERIC_HARDIRQS
	help
	  The industrial I/O subsystem provides a unified framework for
	  drivers for many different types of embedded sensors using a
	  number of different physical interfaces (i2c, spi, etc). See
	  drivers/staging/iio/Documentation for more information.

	depends on HWMON
	help
	  This is a platform driver that in combination with a suitable
	  map allows IIO devices to provide  basic hwmon functionality
	  for those channels specified in the map.

	tristate "Industrial I/O lock free software ring"
	help
	  Example software ring buffer implementation.  The design aim
	  of this particular realization was to minimize write locking
	  with the intention that some devices would be able to write
	  in interrupt context.

config IIO_KFIFO_BUF
	select IIO_TRIGGER
	tristate "Industrial I/O buffering based on kfifo"
	help
	  A simple fifo based on kfifo.  Use this if you want a fifo
	  rather than a ring buffer. Note that this currently provides
	  no buffer events so it is up to userspace to work out how
	  often to read from the buffer.

	help
	  Provides IIO core support for triggers.  Currently these
	  are used to initialize capture of samples to push into
	  ring buffers.  The triggers are effectively a 'capture
	  data now' interrupt.

	This value controls the maximum number of consumers that a
	given trigger may handle. Default is 2.
