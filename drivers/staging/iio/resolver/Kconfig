	help
	  In normal mode, the resolution of the digital output is selected
	  using the RES0 and RES1 input pins. In configuration mode, the
	  resolution is selected by setting the RES0 and RES1 bits in the
	  control regsiter. When switching between normal mode and configuration
	  mode, there are some schemes to keep them matchs.

	help
	  GPIO pins are sampling RES0 and RES1 pins, read the resolution
	  settings from the GPIO pins.

	help
	  RES0 and RES1 pins are controlled by GPIOs, setting GPIO pins to
	  set the resolution.
