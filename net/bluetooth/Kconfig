	  Bluetooth is low-cost, low-power, short-range wireless technology.
	  It was designed as a replacement for cables and other short-range
	  technologies like IrDA.  Bluetooth operates in personal area range
	  that typically extends up to 10 meters.  More information about
	  Bluetooth can be found at <http://www.bluetooth.com/>.

	  Linux Bluetooth subsystem consist of several layers:
<<<<<<< HEAD
	     Bluetooth Core
		HCI device and connection manager, scheduler
		SCO audio links
		L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol)
		SMP (Security Manager Protocol) on LE (Low Energy) links
	     HCI Device drivers (Interface to the hardware)

	     RFCOMM Module (RFCOMM Protocol)  
	     BNEP Module (Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol)
	     CMTP Module (CAPI Message Transport Protocol)
	     HIDP Module (Human Interface Device Protocol)

	  Say Y here to compile Bluetooth support into the kernel or say M to
	  compile it as module (bluetooth).

	  To use Linux Bluetooth subsystem, you will need several user-space
	  utilities like hciconfig and bluetoothd.  These utilities and updates
	  to Bluetooth kernel modules are provided in the BlueZ packages.  For
	  more information, see <http://www.bluez.org/>.

	  L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol) provides
	  connection oriented and connection-less data transport.  L2CAP
	  support is required for most Bluetooth applications.

	  Also included is support for SMP (Security Manager Protocol) which
	  is the security layer on top of LE (Low Energy) links.

config BT_SCO
	bool "SCO links support"
	help
	  SCO link provides voice transport over Bluetooth.  SCO support is
	  required for voice applications like Headset and Audio.
